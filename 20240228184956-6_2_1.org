#+title: 6.2.1 (Morphism)
A *morphism* from a projective geometry $G_1$ to a projective geometry $G_2$ is
a partial map $g: G_1 \dashrightarrow G_2$ satisfying the following axioms:

1. (M_1) $N \coloneqq \operatorname{Ker} g$ is a subspace of $G_1$,
2. (M_2) if $a, b \not\in N$, $c \in N$ and $a \in b \star c$, then $ga = gb$,
3. (M_3) if $a, b, c \not\in N$ and $a \in b \star c$, then $ga \in gb \star gc$.


A morphism is called *non-degenerate* if its image contains con-collinear points.
