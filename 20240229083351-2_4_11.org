#+title: 2.4.11 (Hyperplane)
A *hyperplane* of a projective geometry $G$ is a [[id:c3e001b8-3da9-42f9-b8af-d8d9db4f3e50][subspace]] $H$ of $G$ which is
maximal among the strict subspaces of $G$. Hence a subspace $H \subseteq G$ is a
hyperplane if and only if it is a coatom of the lattice $\mathscr{L}(G)$. We
denote by $G^{*}$ the set of all hyperplanes of $G$.
