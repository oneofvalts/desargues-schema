#+title: 2.3.1 (Subspace, Projective subgeometry)
1) A *subspace* of a projective geometry *G* is a subset $E \subseteq G$
   satisfying
   $$
   a, b \in E \implies a \star b \subseteq E.
   $$
2) A *projective subgeometry* of a projective geometry $G$ is a subset $G'
   \subseteq G$ such that $G'$ together with the restriction $\ell' \coloneqq
   \ell \cap (G' \times G' \times G')$ of the operator $\ell$ to $G'$ is also a
   projective geometry.
