#+title: 2.7.1 (Irreducible projective geometry)
A projective geometry $G$ is called *irreducible* if $a, b \in G$ and $a \neq b$
implies that there exists $c \in a \star b$ with $a \neq c \neq b$.
Geometrically, this means that every line contains at least three points.
Otherwise the projective geometry is called *reducible*.
