#+title: 7.2.7 (Equivalent conditions for being a subspace-embedding)
For a morphism $g: G_1 \dashrightarrow G_2$ of projective geometries the following
conditions are equivalent:
1. $g$ is an embedding and $\operatorname{Im} g$ is a subspace of $G_2$,
2. $g$ is an initial homomorphism,
3. $g$ is a [[id:3d9d2ae6-3fa1-4f6f-bd89-76b87423f5c2][homomorphism]] with empty kernel,
4. $g = i \circ u$ where $u$ is an isomorphism and $i$ the inclusion of a
   subspace,
5. $g = v \circ j$ where $j$ is the inclusion of a subspace and $v$ and
  isomorphism,
6. there exists a homomorphism $r: G_2 \dashrightarrow G_1$ such that $r \circ g =
   \operatorname{Id}_{G_1}$,
7. $g$ is a section of the category $\mathbf{{Proj}}$ (cf. 7.2.1).
